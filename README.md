This is my branch of Grace Huang's "Number Randomizer" "Learn SwiftUI" App.  See the initial commit comment for things I had to change to make this work in my
environment.  There are still odd console messages issued by the app about non-match of String tags, and an apparent ongoing issue that troubles all apps concerning TextField boxes.
