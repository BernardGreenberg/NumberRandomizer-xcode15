This is my branch of Grace Huang's "Number Randomizer" "Learn SwiftUI" App.  See the initial commit comment for things I had to change to make this work in my
environment.  There are still odd console messages issued by the app about non-match of String tags, and an apparent ongoing issue that troubles all apps concerning TextField boxes.

GitHub won't let me make it private, so just ignore it.   It's only here for my learning SwiftUI.
