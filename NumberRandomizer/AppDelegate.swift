/* This is not currently used in the build -- the "Window vs WindowGroup" solution, creating
a single-window App, works better for getting it to exit when the window is closed.  But including
this, and 
  @NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate
in the App structure, really does add this AppKit clichÃ© to the SwiftUI app, and works, too (and
allows multiple windows, fwiw.
